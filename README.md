Older versions
-----------------------
The earlier versions of MDroid, v1.0 - v5.x, were all built using parsing as a method to get data from Moodle. This could vary from each Moodle setup and is definitely not a recommended approach. Since, MDroid started of as an IIT Bombay Moodle support application I had nothing but that approach to take. I moved on to APIs approach now, which means web services are required for the current version of MDroid to work. You can still find the older versions code on other branches of this repository but it is highly recommended that you take the APIs approach as well.
