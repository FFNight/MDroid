In production
----------------------
Please not this is not the current version of MDroid that is in *production* on
playstore right now. You may find the current version on playstore in the branch
Version 5.0


Development
----------------------
We are taking the APIs approach and once we make some good progress 
on this APIs approach, this will be pushed to production. To know more about our
approach, read Parsing-APIs section below.


Parsing-APIs
-----------------------
All versions of MDroid that went to production so far, v1.0 - v4.4, are all use
parsing as a method to get data from Moodle. This could vary from each Moodle 
setup and is definitely not a recommended approach. Since, MDroid started of as
an IIT Bombay Moodle support application we had nothing but that approach to take.
Now that we have the usage of MDroid on various Moodle servers, I would like to
inform you that we are now working on an APIs based version of MDroid. Once all
the work on APIs version has been complete, we will be putting it in production.
Since this in our major concentration for the next update, we are simple doing 
the development of APIs on the master branch.
