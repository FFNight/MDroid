Version 5.0
----------------------
This is the current version in *production* This version is built upon version 4.0
and adds notification services to MDroid. This also introduces Sqllite to cache
moodle data.


Development
----------------------
Although this is current branch in *production* and there could a few more 
releases on playstore based on this branch, we shall soon be moving to a new 
approach to get data from Moodle. Read Parsing-APIs section for more info. If 
you still want to take the parsing approach for Moodle data this is the right
place for you.


Parsing-APIs
-----------------------
All versions of MDroid that went to production so far, v1.0 - v4.4, are all use
parsing as a method to get data from Moodle. This could vary from each Moodle 
setup and is definitely not a recommended approach. Since, MDroid started for as
an IIT Bombay Moodle support application we had nothing but this approach to take.
Now that we have the usage of MDroid on various Moodle servers, I would like to
inform you that we shall be working on an APIs based version of MDroid. Once all
the work on that version has been complete, we will be putting that in production.
This version may still be available as a legacy support application but it is
recommended that you contact your Moodle administrators to enable web services so
that you can the upcoming and furture versions of MDroid.
